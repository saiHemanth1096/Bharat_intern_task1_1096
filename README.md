project submissions regarding Bharat Internship Task 1 Iris Classification


project submissions regarding Bharat Internship Project 1: Iris Flowers Classification Overview :- Welcome to the repository for my Bharat internship Task 1! In this project, I implemented a machine learning model for Iris Flowers Classification. The goal was to predict different species of flowers based on the length of their petals and sepals. The entire project is coded in a Jupyter notebook.

Project Highlights :-
Techniques Used:- Machine Learning, Iris Dataset, Jupyter Notebook Key Features:- -> Utilized machine learning algorithms to classify iris flowers. -> Focused on the length of petals and sepals for precise classification. -> Achieved high accuracy using advanced techniques.

Getting Started :- To explore the project, simply open the Jupyter notebook file: iris_classification.ipynb. Acknowledgments :- I express my gratitude to the Bharat internship program for providing this learning opportunity.
